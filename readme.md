total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
    total_height += height
print(total_height)


```
finds the highest

This code:
```python
# number_of_student = len(student_heights)
number_of_student = 0
for student in student_heights:
    number_of_student += 1
print(number_of_student)
```
calculates the number of students' heights
